                <p>Since the inception of Indian culture, it has stressed in examination of various kinds. In earlier time examination were more of practical rather than on theory basis. Students were to solve the real problems which are being faced in life. At that point of time exams were focused into physical fitness, concentration and related to mental activity. Surrounding of education system in India is abysmal. Indian education system is influenced by political aspect, it is aimed at, making money rather than on providing quality education. As an advent of time this approach is degrading by making the education system more transparent and approachable. Now, approach towards exam have changed, exams are digitized, any individual can give exam by sitting at their home.
